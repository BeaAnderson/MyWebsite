      <p>Hi, my nameâ€™s Bea. I'm a software developer with fdm group. My degree background is in optometry and
      I got into software development mostly through my partner.</p> 
      <p>At the time she was doing computer science at college and I was interested in it so she encouraged me to learn some python.
      Since then most of my development experience has been in java and react.</p>
      <p>In my spare time I enjoy photography and you can find examples of my work under photography on this site</p>
      <p>I've included some helpful links below so you can find me elsewhere:</p>
